 [mixture index of fit](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2346187)
 in a variety of settings.


The mixture index of fit is a measure of model fit that is easy to interpret,
applies to many different models, and unlike conventional measures of model
fit rests on assumptions that are always true.
The index measures model fit by the smallest fraction of the population that
cannot be described perfectly by a distribution belonging to the model, and
facilitates new substantive findings through the analysis of the residual
component.  
The `pistar` package currently allows to estimate the index for 
univariate distributions, multivariate normal distribution, and all models
which input and predict values representable as contingency tables.
